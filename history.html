            <h2>Majorvilles Humble Beginings</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Majorville is located on Lake Michigan where Pine Creek empties into Lake Michigan just south of Esky Road.  Today this is one of the most popular swimming beaches in the Lakeshore, but in the 1870s and 1880s, Majorville was a booming lumber town! <br><br> Following the U. S. Civil War, the veterans returned home, and John Major settled with his wife Julia and daughter Anna in Northern Michigan. <br><br> Lumber speculators soon arrived looking for stands of white pine. Most of the forest in this area was hardwood, but there were some stands of white pine inland from Pine Lake. Lumber speculators were on their way north as the forests near Grand Haven and Muskegon were harvested. <br><br> Dr. Arthur O&apos;Leary recognized the financial potential of the timber stands around Pine Creek. He began buying up large tracts of forest and made plans to build a sawmill. O&apos;Leary didn&apos;t have any experience in the lumber business, so he began looking for someone who could manage his enterprise. He found Charles T. Wright.
                Charles Wright would become the manager of the lumber operation at Pine Creek.
